  *                                                                           *
  * Layouts are simply top-level HTML templates you can use as wrappers for   *
  * your server-side views. If you're using ejs or jade, you can take         *
  * advantage of Sails' built-in `layout` support.                            *
  *                                                                           *
  * When using a layout, when one of your views is served, it is injected     *
  * into the `body` partial defined in the layout. This lets you reuse header *
  * and footer logic between views.                                           *
  *                                                                           *
  * NOTE: Layout support is only implemented for the `ejs` view engine!       *
  *       For most other engines, it is not necessary, since they implement   *
  *       partials/layouts themselves. In those cases, this config will be    *
  *       silently ignored.                                                   *
  *                                                                           *
  * The `layout` setting may be set to one of the following:                  *
  *                                                                           *
  * If `false`, layouts will be disabled. Otherwise, if a string is           *
  * specified, it will be interpreted as the relative path to your layout     *
  * file from `views/` folder. (the file extension, ".ejs", should be         *
  * omitted)                                                                  *
  *                                                                           *

  * Using Multiple Layouts                                                    *

  * If you're using the default `ejs` or `handlebars` Sails supports the use  *
  * of multiple `layout` files. To take advantage of this, before rendering a *
  * view, override the `layout` local in your controller by setting           *
  * `res.locals.layout`. (this is handy if you parts of your app's UI look    *
  * completely different from each other)                                     *
  *                                                                           *
  * e.g. your default might be                                                *
  * layout: 'layouts/public'                                                  *
  *                                                                           *
  * But you might override that in some of your controllers with:             *
  * layout: 'layouts/internal'                                                *
  *                                                                           *

  * Partials are simply top-level snippets you can leverage to reuse template *
  * for your server-side views. If you're using handlebars, you can take      *
  * advantage of Sails' built-in `partials` support.                          *

  * If `false` or empty partials will be located in the same folder as views. *
  * Otherwise, if a string is specified, it will be interpreted as the        *
  * relative path to your partial files from `views/` folder.                 *
  *                                                                           *
